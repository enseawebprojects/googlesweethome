# Google Sweet Home
An estate search engine driven by users well-being

## Objective

The goal of this project is to provide a sorted list of estate offers based on the user's subjective preference about well-being.
For example, some user TOTO likes swimming, watching Louis Jouvet's films in good old independant cinemas, and hates mountains. 
TOTO would like to know were are the best places to live in France according to these preferences. 
This project particularly involves a cartographic mapping of a large set of places (pizzerias, swimming pools, etc...), 
for example using information gathered from http://www.pagesjaunes.fr/. 
The application must :
* Allow creation of several user profiles
* Show a colored map of well-being as defined by the user's profile
* Request other estate websites for offers that fit these well-being constraints and sort them accordingly
